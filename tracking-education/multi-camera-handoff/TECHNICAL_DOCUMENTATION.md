# Technical Documentation: Multi-Camera Object Tracking System

## System Architecture

The Multi-Camera Object Tracking System consists of several integrated subsystems:

1. **Distributed Camera Network**
   - Multiple camera nodes capturing video streams
   - Local processing on each camera node
   - Network communication between nodes

2. **Centralized Coordination Server**
   - Receives processed data from camera nodes
   - Manages global object identities
   - Handles tracking handoffs between cameras
   - Provides unified visualization

3. **Calibration Subsystem**
   - Establishes spatial relationships between cameras
   - Creates unified coordinate system
   - Identifies overlapping fields of view

4. **Object Detection Module**
   - Detects objects of interest in each camera view
   - Extracts features for re-identification
   - Classifies object types

5. **Tracking Module**
   - Maintains object identity within each camera view
   - Predicts object trajectories
   - Manages identity handoff between cameras

6. **Visualization Module**
   - Displays multi-camera view
   - Shows object trajectories across cameras
   - Provides system status and metrics

## Implementation Details

### Camera Network Setup

The system uses a distributed architecture:

1. **Camera Nodes**
   - Each Raspberry Pi + camera operates as a node
   - Performs initial object detection and feature extraction
   - Tracks objects within its own field of view
   - Sends object data to coordination server

2. **Network Communication**
   - Uses ZeroMQ for efficient message passing
   - Implements heartbeat protocol for node status monitoring
   - Synchronizes timing across nodes

3. **Central Server**
   - Aggregates data from all camera nodes
   - Runs on more powerful hardware (PC/server)
   - Manages global state and visualization

### Camera Calibration

The calibration process establishes spatial relationships:

1. **Intrinsic Calibration**
   - Calibrates each camera individually using checkerboard pattern
   - Corrects for lens distortion
   - Establishes camera-specific parameters

2. **Extrinsic Calibration**
   - Determines relative positions of cameras
   - Uses moving object detection across multiple views
   - Creates transformation matrices between camera coordinates

3. **Overlap Detection**
   - Identifies shared fields of view between cameras
   - Maps transition zones for handoff
   - Creates visibility map of the entire monitored area

### Object Detection and Feature Extraction

The system implements two-stage detection:

1. **Object Detection**
   - Uses MobileNet SSD for efficient object detection
   - Identifies multiple object classes
   - Provides bounding boxes for detected objects

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extracts appearance features from detected objects
   - Creates feature vectors for re-identification
   - Focuses on stable features across different viewpoints

3. **Object Classification**
   - Categorizes detected objects by type
   - Applies different tracking parameters based on object class
   - Filters objects based on configured criteria

### Tracking and Handoff

The tracking system maintains object identity:

1. **Single-Camera Tracking**
   - Uses SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm
   - Maintains object identity through Kalman filtering
   - Handles occlusions within a single view

2. **Handoff Prediction**
   - Predicts when objects will leave one camera's field of view
   - Estimates entry point into adjacent camera views
   - Calculates time window for expected transitions

3. **Re-identification**
   - Compares feature vectors of objects in transition zones
   - Uses appearance and motion information
   - Assigns confidence scores to potential matches

4. **Global ID Management**
   - Maintains consistent identity across all cameras
   - Resolves conflicting identifications
   - Handles reappearance after blind spots

### Trajectory Analysis

The system provides advanced trajectory functionality:

1. **Path Recording**
   - Stores object trajectories in global coordinate system
   - Interpolates position through blind spots
   - Creates continuous paths across camera transitions

2. **Motion Prediction**
   - Uses Kalman filtering for short-term prediction
   - Employs trajectory modeling for longer predictions
   - Estimates time of arrival at future locations

3. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Identifies common movement patterns
   - Detects unusual trajectories
   - Analyzes speed and acceleration profiles

## Hardware Configuration

### Camera Positioning

Optimal camera arrangement:
- Positioned to create overlapping fields of view at transition points
- Typically 2-3 meters height for indoor settings
- 15-30% view overlap between adjacent cameras
- Consistent lighting conditions when possible

### Processing Requirements

- Each Raspberry Pi handles detection and tracking for one camera
- 5-10 FPS processing at 640x480 resolution per camera
- Central server requires multicore CPU for coordination
- Network bandwidth ~5 Mbps per camera for compressed features

## Limitations and Considerations

- Re-identification accuracy decreases with similar-looking objects
- Performance degrades in extremely crowded scenes
- Lighting variations affect feature matching between cameras
- System latency increases with number of cameras
- Physical blind spots cannot be directly observed

## Future Improvements

- Implement deep learning re-identification models
- Add appearance modeling that adapts to viewing angle
- Develop more sophisticated trajectory prediction
- Create 3D space reconstruction from multiple 2D views
- Implement distributed processing architecture for scalability
