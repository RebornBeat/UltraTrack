## Implementation Details

### Person Detection

The system uses a multi-stage approach for person detection:

1. **Primary Detection**
   - HOG + SVM detector for initial person detection
   - Optional MobileNet SSD for improved accuracy
   - Confidence filtering to reduce false positives

2. **Region of Interest Optimization**
   - Configurable zones for focused detection
   - Background modeling to identify areas of movement
   - Exclusion zones for static objects

### Privacy Preservation

Privacy is maintained through several mechanisms:

1. **Face Detection and Blurring**
   - Uses Haar Cascade or CNN-based face detection
   - Applies Gaussian blur to detected face regions
   - Ensures no recognizable faces are stored

2. **Feature Anonymization**
   - Prevents extraction of biometric features
   - Converts people to anonymized bounding boxes
   - No storage of appearance features

3. **Data Protection**
   - Aggregate statistics rather than individual tracking
   - Automatic data aging and deletion
   - No network transmission of raw video

### Tracking System

The tracking system maintains anonymous identity:

1. **Centroid Tracking**
   - Assigns ID based on centroid position
   - Uses Kalman filtering for motion prediction
   - Handles short-term occlusions

2. **Zone Transition Recording**
   - Logs movement between defined areas
   - Maintains count of people per zone
   - Records entry/exit events

3. **Trajectory Analysis**
   - Analyzes common movement paths
   - Identifies high-traffic corridors
   - Detects unusual movement patterns

### Analytics Capabilities

The system provides several analytical functions:

1. **Occupancy Analysis**
   - Real-time count of people per zone
   - Historical occupancy patterns by time
   - Peak occupancy detection

2. **Flow Analysis**
   - Directional movement between zones
   - Identification of main pathways
   - Bottleneck detection

3. **Temporal Patterns**
   - Time-based activity patterns
   - Recurring movement cycles
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

## Hardware Configuration

### Camera Positioning

Optimal camera placement for pedestrian tracking:
- Overhead mounting (2.5-3m height) for best results
- Angle of 30-45 degrees if overhead mounting isn't possible
- Field of view covering complete zones of interest
- Minimal occlusion from furniture or fixtures

### Processing Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) handles 1-2 cameras at 640x480 resolution
- Frame rate of 5-10 FPS sufficient for most analytics
- Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 recommended for improved performance
- GPU-accelerated system recommended for 4+ cameras

## Limitations and Considerations

- Tracking accuracy decreases in crowded scenes
- Occlusions can cause identity switches between people
- Varying lighting conditions affect detection reliability
- Privacy preservation techniques may reduce tracking accuracy
- System designed for pattern analysis, not individual tracking

## Future Improvements

- Implement pose estimation for more detailed movement analysis
- Add depth cameras for improved tracking in crowded scenes
- Integrate machine learning for behavioral pattern recognition
- Implement cross-camera tracking with privacy preservation
- Add predictive analytics for congestion forecasting
