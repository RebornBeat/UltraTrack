# Basic Traffic Monitoring System

A student-focused educational project for building a simple traffic monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and computer vision techniques.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a basic traffic monitoring system capable of:
- Detecting vehicles in video streams
- Counting traffic flow
- Estimating vehicle speed
- Basic license plate recognition
- Storing traffic data in a database
- Visualizing traffic patterns

## Educational Objectives

- Learn fundamentals of computer vision
- Understand basic object detection techniques
- Implement simple tracking algorithms
- Work with camera hardware and Raspberry Pi
- Store and analyze time-series data
- Create visualization dashboards

## Components Required

- Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+ RAM)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB webcam
- MicroSD card (16GB+)
- Power supply
- Optional: Weather-resistant case for outdoor deployment
- Optional: Additional cameras for multi-angle coverage

## Installation

Follow the step-by-step guide in [Installation Guide](docs/installation_guide.md) to set up your system.

## Usage

1. Position the camera to overlook a traffic area
2. Configure the system parameters in `config/system_settings.json`
3. Run the system: `python -m src.main`
4. Access the visualization dashboard at http://localhost:8050

## Project Extensions

- Add traffic light timing optimization
- Implement cloud data backup
- Create time-of-day traffic pattern analysis
- Add vehicle classification (car, truck, motorcycle, etc.)
- Implement multi-camera integration

## Exploration Questions

1. How does the positioning of the camera affect detection accuracy?
2. What is the maximum distance at which the system can reliably detect vehicles?
3. How do weather conditions affect the system's performance?
4. What privacy considerations should be taken into account when deploying such a system?
5. How could this system be integrated with traffic light control?

## Ethical Guidelines

This project is designed for educational purposes only. When deploying any camera system:
- Ensure you have permission to monitor the area
- Do not store personally identifiable information
- Consider privacy implications and local regulations
- Use data only for educational analysis
