# Basic Traffic Monitoring System

A student-focused educational project for building a simple traffic monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and computer vision techniques.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a basic traffic monitoring system capable of:
- Detecting vehicles in video streams
- Counting traffic flow
- Estimating vehicle speed
- Basic license plate recognition
- Storing traffic data in a database
- Visualizing traffic patterns

## Educational Objectives

- Learn fundamentals of computer vision
- Understand basic object detection techniques
- Implement simple tracking algorithms
- Work with camera hardware and Raspberry Pi
- Store and analyze time-series data
- Create visualization dashboards

## Components Required

- Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+ RAM)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB webcam
- MicroSD card (16GB+)
- Power supply
- Optional: Weather-resistant case for outdoor deployment
- Optional: Additional cameras for multi-angle coverage

## Installation

Follow the step-by-step guide in [Installation Guide](docs/installation_guide.md) to set up your system.

## Usage

1. Position the camera to overlook a traffic area
2. Configure the system parameters in `config/system_settings.json`
3. Run the system:
