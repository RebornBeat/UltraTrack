# Technical Documentation: Basic Traffic Monitoring System

## System Architecture

The Basic Traffic Monitoring System is structured as a pipeline with the following components:

1. **Video Capture Module**
   - Interfaces with camera hardware
   - Provides configurable frame rate and resolution
   - Handles multiple video sources (if available)

2. **Vehicle Detection Module**
   - Uses background subtraction to identify moving objects
   - Applies object classification to identify vehicles
   - Implements basic tracking to maintain vehicle identity between frames

3. **License Plate Recognition Module**
   - Detects license plate regions within vehicle images
   - Applies image preprocessing (contrast enhancement, binarization)
   - Uses Tesseract OCR to extract license plate text
   - Implements validation to filter incorrect readings

4. **Analysis Module**
   - Counts vehicles passing detection zones
   - Estimates vehicle speed using time-distance measurements
   - Analyzes traffic flow patterns and density

5. **Database Module**
   - Stores traffic data in PostgreSQL database
   - Maintains time-series data for historical analysis
   - Implements data pruning for long-term storage management

6. **Visualization Module**
   - Provides real-time traffic monitoring dashboard
   - Displays historical traffic patterns
   - Generates traffic reports and statistics

## Implementation Details

### Vehicle Detection

The system uses a combination of techniques for vehicle detection:

1. Background Subtraction
   - Maintains a background model using MOG2 algorithm
   - Identifies moving objects as foreground
   - Applies morphological operations to clean detection masks

2. Object Classification
   - Uses a lightweight CNN model to classify detected objects
   - Identifies vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects
   - Filters non-vehicle detections

3. Vehicle Tracking
   - Implements simple tracking using centroid method
   - Maintains vehicle identity across consecutive frames
   - Uses Kalman filtering for trajectory prediction

### License Plate Recognition

The LPR module follows these steps:

1. License Plate Detection
   - Uses cascade classifier to identify license plate regions
   - Extracts plate region with margin for processing

2. Image Preprocessing
   - Applies adaptive thresholding to handle lighting variations
   - Performs perspective correction if necessary
   - Enhances contrast to improve OCR accuracy

3. Text Recognition
   - Uses Tesseract OCR with specific configuration for license plates
   - Applies post-processing to filter and validate detected text
   - Uses regular expressions to match license plate formats

### Performance Considerations

- The basic system processes 10-15 FPS at 720p resolution on Raspberry Pi 4
- License plate recognition operates as a background task to maintain performance
- System uses efficient data storage to manage limited resources
- Configurable parameters allow balancing performance vs. accuracy

## Hardware Setup

### Camera Positioning

Optimal camera positioning for traffic monitoring:
- Mounted 4-6 meters above the ground
- Angle of 30-45 degrees toward the road
- Field of view covering 10-20 meters of road length
- Minimal obstruction and consistent lighting if possible

### Raspberry Pi Configuration

Recommended Raspberry Pi setup:
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
- Expanded swap file (1GB) for improved performance
- Disabled unnecessary services
- Camera module enabled in raspi-config
- Optional cooling solution for sustained operation

## Limitations and Considerations

- Detection accuracy varies with lighting conditions
- License plate recognition works best with clean, unobstructed plates
- System performance degrades with increased traffic density
- Weather conditions (rain, snow, fog) may impact detection quality
- Privacy considerations limit storing identifiable information

## Future Improvements

- Implement YOLO-based detection for improved accuracy
- Add vehicle classification capabilities
- Integrate with traffic signal systems
- Implement edge AI processing for improved performance
- Add cloud connectivity for data aggregation
